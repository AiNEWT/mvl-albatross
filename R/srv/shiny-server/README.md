# Albatross - My Shiny App
This is a simple Shiny app that I created to demonstrate how to use R Studio's Shiny Server. The app allows users to enter a name and age, and then it displays a greeting message personalized to the user.

# How to use the app
- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
- Open the app.R file in RStudio.
- Run the app by clicking the Run App button.
- The app will open in a new browser window.
- Enter your name and age in the text boxes.
- Click the Submit button.
- The app will display a greeting message personalized to you.

# Requirements
- R Studio
- R Shiny Server
- Deployment

The app can be deployed to Shiny Server by following these steps:

- Create a new Shiny Server application.
- Upload the app.R file to the Shiny Server application.
- Start the Shiny Server application.
